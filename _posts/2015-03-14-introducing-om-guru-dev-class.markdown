Have you ever wondered how sites like Gmail and Facebook are so interactive? They have sophisticated data and server technologies, but _a lot of_ this magic actually happens through your web browser (the "front-end") itself. 
Want to learn how to make some of this magic happen using technologies invented to develop Facbeook and Instagram?

The "ॐ Guru Dev" (formerly “Become a Front-end Ninja!”) course will teach you how to use a framework called Om to become a guru in front-end dev(elopment). You'll become an ॐ Guru Dev. [Sign-up here](http://edushala.com/learn/technology/8967cf544e144cdb82886f401af9a602/%7Bslug%7D); there is a big blue "Enroll Now" button on that page.

Jokes aside, you will learn how to make awesome front-end web apps using clojurescript, Om, and some great technologies like core.async. If you've never heard of those things before, don't worry, they are technologies that are built on top of javascript and React.js, which developers at Facebook came up with to help them make Instagram and Facebook. We will also talk more about these technologies on the class blog to convince you that they are worth learning :)

Technologies aside, LEARNING will be PROJECT-BASED. You will be expected to come up with a project, or choose one of the various ideas that we have solicited from various organizations in Nepal. We will do six weekly 2-hour classes, but most of the learning will take place by building your projects and some initial assignments where you are learning the basics.

At the end of the course, participants will come out with a signficant front-end application you build using ClojureScript & Om. We'll make sure it will impress your friends for sure. And if you devote the time, you can also make it impress future employers!
