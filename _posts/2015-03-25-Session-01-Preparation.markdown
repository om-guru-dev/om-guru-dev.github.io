TL;DR: You should go through the following before class on Friday: <a href="https://github.com/shaunlebron/ClojureScript-Syntax-in-15-minutes">Clojurescript Syntax in 15 minutes</a>, <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/">Brave Clojure: Do Things</a>, & <a href="http://clojurescriptkoans.com/">Clojurescript Koans</a>. But do read on...

We'll be trying to incorporate a [flipped classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model in the OM Ninja sessions. The rough idea is that "lessons" will be delivered via tutorials that you can follow at home, and "class"-time will be more for exploring some of the tricky things we encounter, asking questions and reviewing grasp of things, and explaining the things that you may find strange new and exciting during these tutorial sessions.

We're planning to become ninjas, better get used to some flips, right?!

###### Assignment 0

You should go through the following before class on Friday:

 * [Clojurescript Syntax in 15 minutes](https://github.com/shaunlebron/ClojureScript-Syntax-in-15-minutes)
 * [Clojure Brave -- Intro Chapter](http://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/) (skip section 4)
 * [Clojurescript Koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com/) (skip individual questions if you get stuck (using the URL bar), but take notes of which ones; we will discuss these in class.

The first one will give you a very very basic intro to Clojurescript. The second one is a clojure-focused resource, but clojurescript is basically clojure that runs on the browser, so almost everything it tells you is useful. Plus the guide is such a fun read. For now, just get a sense of things; no need to actually set up clojure and try the code yourself.
The final item, clojurescript koans, is hopefully a fun way to get started with trying out a little bit of clojurescript yourself without requiring anything to set up.

Have fun! Feel free to email any questions to [front-end-nepal@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/front-end-nepal)
