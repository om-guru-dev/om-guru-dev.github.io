In Session 2 class, we saw a glimpse of Om. You will develop this brief glimpse into a deeper knowledge of Om by implementing large parts of TodoMVC.

For preparing for Session 3, you will need to:
 
 * Go through [Your First Components](https://github.com/om-ninja/om-tutorial/wiki/1.-Your-First-Components) in this tutorial series
 * Complete the assignments within the tutorial.
 * [Optional]: Read [Clojure for the Brave and True: More on Core Functions](http://www.braveclojure.com/core-functions-in-depth/). This will take you through the amazing Clojure(script) standard library, which is all sorts of fun. Note that you won't be able to do file read / writes at the end, but hope that is okay.
